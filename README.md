## *Authors: Edoardo Botta, Utkarsh Priyam, Hemit Shah*

This is the official repository of "EDGE-Rec: Efficient and Data-Guided Edge Diffusion for Recommender System Graphs", submitted as final project for the CMU course 10-708: Probabilistic Graphical Models.

### Replicability
We train for 10000 iterations on a single A100 GPU in the Google Colab environment with batch size 16.
Results can be replicated step-by-step by running the [execute.ipynb](https://github.com/upriyam-cmu/10-708-Final-Project/blob/main/execute.ipynb) notebook.
